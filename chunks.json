In today's global world, knowledge is the only source for\nfurther evalua\u019fon and progress of a Country. The challenge that Universi\u019fes and ins\u019ftutes of higher\nlearning would face in this scenario, is to remain commited to excellence while maintaining the high\nstandards of educa\u019fon and research. Another challenge would be to engage in quality improvement by\nbuilding on alliances and collabora\u019fve partnership with the stakeholders including industry and sister\nins\u019ftu\u019fons. It is indeed a mater of great sa\u019fsfac\u019fon for me to note that signi\ufb01cant improvement has been\nmade in the \ufb01eld of engineering and technical educa\u019fon at the university in accordance na\u019fonal and\ninterna\u019fonal standards, with die emphasis on research and applied disciplines demand of relevant to the\nneed of \u019fme.

Multan was an important city even before\nIslam, but it gained importance a\u014cer the arrival of Islam. Hence most of the cra\u014cs and monuments of\nar\u019fs\u019fc value are clearly in\ufb02uenced by Islam. So, Multan as a tradi\u019fonal city which goes back to the Bronze\nAge, Rich in archaeology and the history, the city has a lot to o\ufb00er for those in search of culture. But, more\nthan anything, it's the monuments that give the region a glory of its own.\nHistory of Multan\nMultan is Pakistan's third largest city by area and \ufb01\u014ch largest by popula\u019fon and is considered as one of the\noldest alive ci\u019fes of the world by the historians. \"Mandinat-ul-Auliyah\", the city of saints (740 \u014c. above Sea\nLevel) is situated almost in the center of Pakistan and is at a distance of almost 950 km from Karachi and\n630 km from Islamabad, right on the main highway and about 6 kilometers from the mighty Chenab, in a\nbend created by the \ufb01ve a\ufb04uent rivers. Today, Multan is a combina\u019fon of the old and new Pakistani\nculture. In addi\u019fon to its economic and cultural value for the Southern Punjab, Multan is becoming a\ncenter of quality educa\u019fonal ins\u019ftu\u019fons in the region. Multan is full to tombs, mosques and other\nmausoleum of Muslim origin. Several Important historians including Masudi (915 A.D), Istakhri (951 A.D)\nand Ibn e Batuta (1334 A.D) visited Multan and they all wrote about the social, cultural and educa\u019fonal\nac\u019fvi\u019fes in this city. It is because of being a historical city that Multan's importance has always been\nrecognized and it has always sustained its eminent and worthy posi\u019fon among the ci\u019fes of this county.\nView Sights\nQasim Bagh, Shah Shams Park, Jinnah Park, Qasim Fort, Damdama, Jheel, Historical Mosques and Tombs\nare important view sights. Multan fort is one of them and now it looks as a part of the city because it is\nnow separated by a road which looks more like a bazaar and remains crowded throughout the day. Nobody\nknows when Multan Fort came into being but it was there and it was admired and desired by kings and\nemperors throughout centuries. It was considered as one o\u014cenest forts of the sub-con\u019fnent from the\ndefense as well as architectural points of view. The language of Multan is Multani. It is one of the oldest\ndialects spoken in southern Punjab. It is a dialect of Punjabi, a mixture of Jhangochi of Punjabi and Sindhi.\nSaraiki is its new name but for centuries. It is mainly spoken in Multan District, Muza\ufb00argarh District and\nadjacent areas. This en\u019fre area has almost the same tradi\u019fons, customs and culture\nWeather\nMultan is one of the hotest ci\u019fes of the country. It features an arid climate with very hot summers and\ncold 'Winters. The city witnesses some of the most extreme temperatures in the country.\nIndustries\nPakistan has dynamic, vigorous and export-oriented tex\u019fle industry that has an overwhelming impact on\neconomy. Tex\u019fle being large industrial sector generates the country's highest export earnings. Other\nindustries include fer\u019flizer industries, rubber industries, plas\u019fc industries etc.\nAbout University", "doc_name": "prospectus.pdf", "page_num": 2, "paragraph": 2, "chunk_id": "prospectus.pdf_p2_par2"}, {"text": "Muhammad Nawaz Shari\ufb00 University of Engineering & Technology (MNS- UET) is a high educa\u019fon degree\nawarding ins\u019ftute located Multan, Pakistan.
